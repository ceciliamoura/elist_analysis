# Overview

From 2019 - 2022 while the overall sales trend is upwards, there's noticeable fluctuations in sales. For example, there seems to be a seasonal pattern with sales peaking around November and then dipping in the subsequent months. This could be due to holiday season and the end-of-year shopping spree. 2020 saw the highest growth, with total sales revenue surging 163% year-over-year, driven by a 31% increase in average order value (AOV) and a 101% jump in order volume. Despite a 15% AOV decline in 2021, order volume still reached a record high (up 6%), suggesting a shift towards lower-priced items. From 2019 to 2022 the average yearly sale revenue was $7M, the average total orders per year was 27K and the AOV was $254. 2020 was the strongest year for both total sales (>$10M)  and average value of orders($300). From 2020-2022 the overall trend has been a decline in all these metrics, but with average values still higher or equal (AOV =) than those registered in 2019.
