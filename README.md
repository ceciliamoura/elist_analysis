# Overview

While the overall sales trend is upwards, there's noticeable fluctuations in saales. For example, there's a dip in sales around March/April, which could be a seasonal trend or due to other factors like economic conditions or market changes. There seems to be a seasonal pattern with sales peaking around November and then dipping in the subsequent months. This could be due to holiday season and the end-of-year shopping spree.
